- Show weather forecast for the next few days
- Display weather icons based on weather conditions

## Getting Started

To get started with Classy Weather, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/classy-weather.git
   ```
````

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd classy-weather
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

Steven-McGinnis: more like this one with emojis etc etc usePopcorn üçø

usePopcorn is a React application that enables users to search for movies, view details, and manage a list of watched movies. This project is part of Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course, Master Modern React from Beginner to Advanced! It serves as a hands-on opportunity to deepen my understanding of React concepts while working with a real-world API.
üìñ About This Project

usePopcorn is a feature-rich movie application that interacts with the OMDB API to fetch movie data. It allows users to:

    Search for movies and display results dynamically.
    View detailed information about a selected movie.
    Add movies to a watched list and manage ratings.

This project helped reinforce foundational and intermediate React concepts through practical application.
‚ú® Features

    Search for Movies: Search the OMDB API for movie titles and display relevant results.
    Detailed Movie Information: View details like plot, actors, and poster for selected movies.
    Watched Movies Management: Track movies you've watched and add personal ratings.

üéì Concepts Practiced

While developing usePopcorn, I gained hands-on experience with:

    Custom hooks for data fetching and API integration.
    Component hierarchy and reusability.
    State management with useState.
    Conditional rendering and error handling.
    Enhancing UX with loading indicators and error messages.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

To run the app locally:

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/usepopcorn.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd usepopcorn

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

npm start

The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
üß© Components

    App.js: Main application component managing state, interactions, and layout.
    NavBar.js: Navigation bar with a search input and result counter.
    MovieList.js: Displays a list of search results.
    MovieDetails.js: Shows detailed information about a selected movie and allows user interactions like rating and adding to the watched list.
    Movie.js: A single movie item display component.
    Main.js: Wraps children in a semantic <main> container.
    Logo.js: Displays a popcorn emoji and the app title.
    Loader.js: Renders a loading message during data fetches.
    ErrorMessage.js: Shows an error message with an icon if something goes wrong.
    Box.js: A container component with toggleable visibility.
    WatchedMoviesList.js: Displays the list of movies added to the watched list.
    WatchedSummary.js: Summarizes the user's watched movies.
    NumResults.js: Displays the number of search results found.

üîß Custom Hooks

    useMovies.js: Fetches movies from the OMDB API based on a user query.

üöÄ Future Improvements

While the current version is fully functional, potential enhancements include:

    Adding persistent data storage with localStorage or an API backend.
    Implementing advanced search features like filters for genres or release years.
    Upgrading styling with Tailwind CSS for a modern design.
