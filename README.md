# Classy Weather ☀️🌦️🌩️

Classy Weather is a React application that allows users to search for the weather in different locations. It uses the Open-Meteo API to fetch weather data and displays it in a user-friendly format. This app specifically uses legacy React class components to manage state and interactions giving me hands on experience with both class and functional components.

## 📖 About This Project

Classy Weather is a feature-rich weather application that interacts with the Open-Meteo API to fetch weather data. It allows users to:

- Search for weather by location
- Display current weather conditions
- Show weather forecast for the next few days
- Display weather icons based on weather conditions

This project helped reinforce foundational and intermediate React concepts through practical application.

## ✨ Features

- **Search for Weather**: Search the Open-Meteo API for weather data by location and display relevant results.
- **Current Weather Conditions**: View current weather conditions including temperature and weather icons.
- **Weather Forecast**: Show weather forecast for the next few days.
- **Weather Icons**: Display weather icons based on weather conditions.

## 🎓 Concepts Practiced

While developing Classy Weather, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Custom hooks for data fetching and API integration.
- Component hierarchy and reusability.
- State management with `useState`.
- Conditional rendering and error handling.
- Enhancing UX with loading indicators and error messages.
- Using legacy React class components.

## 🛠️ How to Run

To run the app locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/classy-weather.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd classy-weather
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The app will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 🧩 Components

- **App.js**: Main application component managing state, interactions, and layout.
- **Weather.js**: Displays weather information for a selected location.
- **Day.js**: A single day weather item display component.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

While the current version is fully functional, potential enhancements include:

- Adding persistent data storage with localStorage or an API backend.
- Implementing advanced search features like filters for specific weather conditions.
- Upgrading styling with Tailwind CSS for a modern design.
